 abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of variation in child development within individuals, across groups, and across tasks, timescales, and contexts, dominant methods in developmental science and education research still favor group averages, short snapshots of time, and single environments. The Learning Variability Network Exchange (LEVANTE) is a framework designed to enable coordinated data collection by research teams worldwide, with the goal of measuring children’s variability. The LEVANTE measure set aims to capture variability in learning outcomes (literacy and numeracy) as well as in core cognitive and social constructs. LEVANTE will yield a large, open access longitudinal dataset for long-term research use, facilitating the science of learning variability and constituting the backbone of a multidisciplinary research network.},
