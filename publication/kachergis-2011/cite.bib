 abstract = {Given that human memory is fallible, it is likely adaptive for people to preferentially encode, retain, and retrieve important items better than insignificant ones. Using a dynamic decision-making paradigm with a  response deadline, we find that humans demonstrate a bias to better remember 1) items with positive rather than  negative value, and 2) items with high-magnitude values. Performance was greater when participants  were  shown all  item-value  pairs simultaneously, and were  thus  able to  selectively  attend  to  high-magnitude values. The same magnitude bias is observed for sequentially studied  positive  items,  but  not  for  negative  items. Decision trajectories  show  participants  sometimes  change  their  minds during  the  course  of  a  trial,  choosing  an  item  after  first moving  toward  the  other.  Changes  of  heart  occurred  more often  for trials  with  negative  items. These  findings  suggest that memory is sensitive to value, and that real-time game paradigms can be used to reveal dynamic memory processes.},
