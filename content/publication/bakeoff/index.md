abstract: "One problem language learners face is extracting word meanings from 
    scenes with many possible referents. Despite the ambiguity of individual   
    situations, a large body of empirical work shows that people are
    able to learn cross-situationally when a word occurs in different 
    situations. Many computational models of cross-situational word learning   
    have been proposed, yet there is little consensus on the main mechanisms 
    supporting learning, in part due to the profusion of disparate studies and models,
    and lack of systematic model comparisons across a wide range of studies. 
    This study compares the performance of several extant models on a dataset 
    of 44 experimental conditions and a total of 1,696 participants.
    Using cross-validation, we fit multiple models representing theories of both
    associative learning and hypothesis-testing theories of word learning, find two  
    best-fitting models, and discuss issues of model and mechanism identifiability. 
    Finally, we test the models' ability to generalize to additional
    experiments, including developmental data."
