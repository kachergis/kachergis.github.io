	year = {2019},
	abstract = {It has long been noted that the best examples, or foci, of color categories tend to align across diverse languages (Berlin and Kay, 1969)--but there is limited documentation of such universal foci in other semantic domains. Here, we explore whether spatial topological categories, such as 'in' and 'on' in English, have focal members comparable to those in color. We document names and best examples of topological spatial relations in Dutch, English, French, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish, and find substantial consensus, both within and across languages, on the best examples of such spatial categories. Our results provide empirical evidence for focal best examples in the spatial domain and contribute further support for a theory of 'natural concepts' in this domain.}

	title = {Exploring informal science interventions to promote children's understanding of natural categories},
	year = {2019},
	abstract = "Categories carve up the world in a structured way, allowing people to inductively reason about the properties of novel exemplars. Children are still in the process of learning category structure, and often fail to leverage the inductive power of these representations to their advantage. For example, young children generally fail to recognize the value of sampling diverse exemplars to support category-wide generalization. This study investigates whether teaching children the structure within a natural category increases diversity-based inductive reasoning. In an informal science learning environment, we presented 259 children aged 5 to 8 years with exemplars of the three main types of birds: raptors, songbirds, and waterbirds. After a short dialogue pointing out the various within-type similarities and between-type differences, children's diversity-based inductive reasoning did not significantly improve, despite them evidencing a better understanding of the category's structure. Instead, children tended to avoid sampling waterbirds, the least typical cluster of birds. These patterns suggest that children's neglect of sample diversity is unlikely to be solely due to their relative ignorance of category structure.",

	title = {Evidence of error-driven cross-situational word learning},
	year = {2019},
	booktitle = {Proceedings of the 41st Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society},
	abstract = {One powerful way children can learn word meanings is via cross-situational learning, the ability to discern consistent word-referent mappings from a series of ambiguous scenes and utterances. Various computational accounts of word learning have been proposed, with mechanisms ranging from storing and testing a single hypothesized referent for each word, to tracking multiple graded associations and selectively strengthening some of them. Nearly all word learning models assume storage of some feasible word-referent mappings from each situation, resulting in a degree of learning proportional to the number of co-occurrences. While these accumulative models would generally predict that incorrect co-occurrences would slow learning, recent empirical work suggests these accounts are incomplete: paradoxically, giving learners incorrect mappings early in training was found to boost performance (Fitneva and Christiansen, 2015).  We test this finding's generality in a new experiment with more items, consider system- and item-level explanations, and find that a model with error-driven learning best accounts for this benefit of initially-inaccurate pairings.}
