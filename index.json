That is, they can be seen as a sequence of subactions and sometimes subgoals. In the motor execution of sequential action, context effects are observed in which later subactions modulate the execution of earlier subactions (e.g., reaching for an overturned mug, people will optimize their grasp to achieve a comfortable end state). A trajectory (movement) adaptation of an often-used paradigm in the study of sequential action, the serial response time task, showed several context effects of which centering behavior is of special interest. Centering behavior refers to the tendency (or strategy) of subjects to move their arm or mouse cursor to a position equidistant to all stimuli in the absence of predictive information, thereby reducing movement time to all possible targets. In the current study, we investigated sequential action in a virtual robotic agent trained using proximal policy optimization, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent was trained to reach for appearing targets, similar to a serial response time task given to humans. We found that agents were more likely to develop centering behavior similar to human subjects after curricularized learning. In our curriculum, we first rewarded agents for reaching targets before introducing a penalty for energy expenditure. When the penalty was applied with no curriculum, many agents failed to learn the task due to a lack of action space exploration, resulting in high variability of agents' performance. Our findings suggest that in virtual agents, similar to infants, early energetic exploration can promote robust later learning. This may have the same effect as infants' curiosity-based learning by which they shape their own curriculum. However, introducing new goals cannot wait too long, as there may be critical periods in development after which agents (as humans) cannot flexibly learn to incorporate new objectives. These lessons are making their way into machine learning and offer exciting new avenues for studying both human and machine learning of sequential action.","tags":null,"title":"A critical period for robust curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning of sequential action in a robot arm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Despite the ambiguity of individual situations, a large body of empirical work shows that people are able to learn cross-situationally when a word occurs in different situations. Many computational models of cross-situational word learning have been proposed, yet there is little consensus on the main mechanisms supporting learning, in part due to the profusion of disparate studies and models, and lack of systematic model comparisons across a wide range of studies. This study compares the performance of several extant models on a dataset of 44 experimental conditions and a total of 1,696 participants. Using cross-validation, we fit multiple models representing theories of both associative learning and hypothesis-testing theories of word learning, find two best-fitting models, and discuss issues of model and mechanism identifiability. Finally, we test the models’ ability to generalize to additional experiments, including developmental data.","tags":null,"title":"A large-scale comparison of cross-situational word learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

The present study revisits recent theoretical analyses of simple sampling models with uniformly-distributed word frequency, and considers a more realistic Zipfian (i.e., power-law) distribution of words and referents. Our new mathematical analysis finds that simple sampling models are unable to account for word learning in feasible time under Zipf-distributed word and referent frequencies. To salvage learning under realistic distributional assumptions, we propose an active learning model which assumes that learners and/or caregivers select (or construct) the contexts from which words are sampled. Using simulations and mathematical analysis, we show that active learners choosing optimal learning situations learn hundreds of times faster than passive learners faced with randomly-sampled situations. Thus, as suggested by past empirical studies, we find theoretical support for the idea that statistical structure in real-world situations--potentially created by the self-directed learner or beneficent teachers--is a potential remedy for the difficulty of learning a Zipf-distributed vocabulary.","tags":null,"title":"Active learners learn what simple samplers cannot: A Zipf-distributed vocabulary from limited data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Parent-reported instruments, such as the Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs), have been shown to provide reliable and valid measures of children's aggregate early language skill. However, CDIs contain hundreds of vocabulary items, some of which may not be heard (and thus learned) equally often by children of varying backgrounds. This study used a database of American English CDIs to identify words demonstrating strong bias for particular demographic groups of children, on dimensions of sex (male vs. female), race (white vs. non-white), and maternal education (high vs. low). For each dimension, many items showed bias; removing these items slightly reduced the magnitude of race- and education-based group differences, but did not eliminate them. Additionally, we investigated how well the relative frequency of words spoken to young girls versus boys predicted sex-based word learning bias, and discuss possible sources of demographic differences in early word learning.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating demographic bias on tests of children’s early vocabulary","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

In particular, high-quality early interactions can facilitate language learning and school performance. The rise of phone-based parenting applications (\\\"apps\\\") could deliver low-cost interventions on parenting style to a wide variety of populations, especially the parents of very young children, who are often difficult to reach in other ways. Yet little is known about the effects of communicating to parents through app-based interventions. In two studies (one preregistered), we showed parents short videos depicting age-appropriate parent-child activities from a parenting app. We found that after watching the video, parents spoke more and made more bids for joint attention, as compared with controls who watched no video (experiment 1) or a science video (experiment 2). These results suggest that activity videos can lead to positive changes in parent engagement, providing support for the use of such videos in parenting interventions.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding the impacts of video-guided activities on parent-child interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Have researchers made progress toward this kind of synthesis for children’s early language learning? Many computational models of early vocabulary learning assume that individual words are learned through an accumulation of environmental input. This assumption is also implicit in empirical work that emphasizes links between language input and learning outcomes. However, models have typically focused on average performance, whereas empirical work has focused on variability. To model individual variability, we relate the tradition of research on accumulator models to item response theory models from psychometrics. This formal connection reveals that currently available data sets do not allow researchers to test the resulting models fully, illustrating a critical need for theory to contribute to shaping new data collection and creating and testing an eventual standard model.","tags":null,"title":"Toward a ``Standard Model'' of Early Language Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Kachergis"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Various computational accounts of word learning have been proposed, with mechanisms ranging from storing and testing a single hypothesized referent for each word, to tracking multiple graded associations and selectively strengthening some of them. Nearly all word learning models assume storage of some feasible word-referent mappings from each situation, resulting in a degree of learning proportional to the number of co-occurrences. While these accumulative models would generally predict that incorrect co-occurrences would slow learning, recent empirical work suggests these accounts are incomplete: paradoxically, giving learners incorrect mappings early in training was found to boost performance (Fitneva and Christiansen, 2015).  We test this finding's generality in a new experiment with more items, consider system- and item-level explanations, and find that a model with error-driven learning best accounts for this benefit of initially-inaccurate pairings.","tags":null,"title":"Evidence of error-driven cross-situational word learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Children are still in the process of learning category structure, and often fail to leverage the inductive power of these representations to their advantage. For example, young children generally fail to recognize the value of sampling diverse exemplars to support category-wide generalization. This study investigates whether teaching children the structure within a natural category increases diversity-based inductive reasoning. In an informal science learning environment, we presented 259 children aged 5 to 8 years with exemplars of the three main types of birds (raptors, songbirds, and waterbirds). After a short dialogue pointing out the various within-type similarities and between-type differences, children's diversity-based inductive reasoning did not significantly improve, despite them evidencing a better understanding of the category's structure. Instead, children tended to avoid sampling waterbirds, the least typical cluster of birds. These patterns suggest that children's neglect of sample diversity is unlikely to be solely due to their relative ignorance of category structure.\\\"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring informal science interventions to promote children's understanding of natural categories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Using a dynamic decision-making paradigm with a  response deadline, we find that humans demonstrate a bias to better remember 1) items with positive rather than  negative value, and 2) items with high-magnitude values. Performance was greater when participants  were  shown all  item-value  pairs simultaneously, and were  thus  able to  selectively  attend  to  high-magnitude values. The same magnitude bias is observed for sequentially studied  positive  items,  but  not  for  negative  items. Decision trajectories  show  participants  sometimes  change  their  minds during  the  course  of  a  trial,  choosing  an  item  after  first moving  toward  the  other.  Changes  of  heart  occurred  more often  for trials  with  negative  items. These  findings  suggest that memory is sensitive to value, and that real-time game paradigms can be used to reveal dynamic memory processes.","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Magnitude and Valence Biases in a Dynamic Memory Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Other measures are tied more closely to orthography (e.g., lexical decision time, visual word-form priming). Semantics and orthography are thus often studied and modeled separately. However, given that concepts must be built upon a foundation of percepts, it seems desirable that models of the human lexicon should mirror this structure. Using a holographic, distributed representation of visual word-forms in BEAGLE [12], a corpus-trained model of semantics and word order, we show that free association data is better explained with the addition of orthographic information. However, we find that orthography plays a minor role in accounting for cue-target strengths in free association data. Thus, it seems that free association is primarily conceptual, relying more on semantic context and word order than word form information.","tags":null,"title":"OrBEAGLE: Integrating Orthography into a Holographic Model of the Lexicon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.
