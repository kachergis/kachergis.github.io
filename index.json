Despite the ambiguity of individual situations, a large body of empirical work shows that people are able to learn cross-situationally when a word occurs in different situations. Many computational models of cross-situational word learning have been proposed, yet there is little consensus on the main mechanisms supporting learning, in part due to the profusion of disparate studies and models, and lack of systematic model comparisons across a wide range of studies. This study compares the performance of several extant models on a dataset of 44 experimental conditions and a total of 1,696 participants. Using cross-validation, we fit multiple models representing theories of both associative learning and hypothesis-testing theories of word learning, find two best-fitting models, and discuss issues of model and mechanism identifiability. Finally, we test the models’ ability to generalize to additional experiments, including developmental data.","tags":[],"title":"A large-scale comparison of cross-situational word learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Have researchers made progress toward this kind of synthesis for children’s early language learning? Many computational models of early vocabulary learning assume that individual words are learned through an accumulation of environmental input. This assumption is also implicit in empirical work that emphasizes links between language input and learning outcomes. However, models have typically focused on average performance, whereas empirical work has focused on variability. To model individual variability, we relate the tradition of research on accumulator models to item response theory models from psychometrics. This formal connection reveals that currently available data sets do not allow researchers to test the resulting models fully, illustrating a critical need for theory to contribute to shaping new data collection and creating and testing an eventual standard model.","tags":["word learning","development","modeling"],"title":"Toward a \"Standard Model\" of Early Language Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The present study revisits recent theoretical analyses of simple sampling models with uniformly-distributed word frequency, and considers a more realistic Zipfian (i.e., power-law) distribution of words and referents. Our new mathematical analysis finds that simple sampling models are unable to account for word learning in feasible time under Zipf-distributed word and referent frequencies. To salvage learning under realistic distributional assumptions, we propose an active learning model which assumes that learners and/or caregivers select (or construct) the contexts from which words are sampled. Using simulations and mathematical analysis, we show that active learners choosing optimal learning situations learn hundreds of times faster than passive learners faced with randomly-sampled situations. Thus, as suggested by past empirical studies, we find theoretical support for the idea that statistical structure in real-world situations--potentially created by the self-directed learner or beneficent teachers--is a potential remedy for the difficulty of learning a Zipf-distributed vocabulary.","tags":[],"title":"Active learners learn what simple samplers cannot- A Zipf-distributed vocabulary from limited data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.-Y.

Various computational accounts of word learning have been proposed, with mechanisms ranging from storing and testing a single hypothesized referent for each word, to tracking multiple graded associations and selectively strengthening some of them. Nearly all word learning models assume storage of some feasible word-referent mappings from each situation, resulting in a degree of learning proportional to the number of co-occurrences. While these accumulative models would generally predict that incorrect co-occurrences would slow learning, recent empirical work suggests these accounts are incomplete: paradoxically, giving learners incorrect mappings early in training was found to boost performance (Fitneva and Christiansen, 2015).  We test this finding's generality in a new experiment with more items, consider system- and item-level explanations, and find that a model with error-driven learning best accounts for this benefit of initially-inaccurate pairings.","tags":[],"title":"Evidence of error-driven cross-situational word learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Children are still in the process of learning category structure, and often fail to leverage the inductive power of these representations to their advantage. For example, young children generally fail to recognize the value of sampling diverse exemplars to support category-wide generalization. This study investigates whether teaching children the structure within a natural category increases diversity-based inductive reasoning. In an informal science learning environment, we presented 259 children aged 5 to 8 years with exemplars of the three main types of birds (raptors, songbirds, and waterbirds). After a short dialogue pointing out the various within-type similarities and between-type differences, children's diversity-based inductive reasoning did not significantly improve, despite them evidencing a better understanding of the category's structure. Instead, children tended to avoid sampling waterbirds, the least typical cluster of birds. These patterns suggest that children's neglect of sample diversity is unlikely to be solely due to their relative ignorance of category structure.\\\"","tags":[],"title":"Exploring informal science interventions to promote children's understanding of natural categories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.
