Previous work using manual annotation strategies and cross- sectional data has found systematic changes in the proportion of faces and hands in the egocentric perspective of young infants. Here, we examine the prevalence of faces and hands in a longitudinal collection of nearly 1700 headcam videos collected from three children along a span of 6 to 32 months of age—the SAYCam dataset (Sullivan, Mei, Perfors, Wojcik, \u0026 Frank, under review). To analyze these naturalistic infant egocentric videos, we first validated the use of a modern convolutional neural network of pose detection (OpenPose) for the detection of faces and hands. We then applied this model to the entire dataset, and found a higher proportion of hands in view than previous reported and a moderate decrease the proportion of faces in children's view across age. In addition, we found variability in the proportion of faces/hands viewed by different children in different locations (e.g., living room vs. kitchen), suggesting that individual activity contexts may shape the social information that infants experience.","tags":null,"title":"Detecting social information in a dense database of infants' natural visual experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Prior work has appealed to contextual information to blunt the impact of ambiguity, and explicit feedback to resolve misunderstandings caused by asymmetry. Using cognitive agent-based simulations we demonstrate that even without contextual scaffolding and before resorting to interactive feedback, communicators using pragmatic inference can actually exploit ambiguity to overcome asymmetry in mental representations. While intuition suggests that ambiguity only aggravates asymmetry, our formal analyses show that pragmatic communicators have a ‘helping hand’: They can use ambiguity to trade computationally leaner pragmatic inference for costly interactional turbulence. This novel theoretical approach to a longstanding linguistic problem establishes a new paradigm for explaining natural language use.","tags":null,"title":"Pragmatic communicators can overcome asymmetry by exploiting ambiguity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

We document names and best examples of topological spatial relations in Dutch, English, French, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish, and find substantial consensus, both within and across languages, on the best examples of such spatial categories. Our results provide empirical evidence for focal best examples in the spatial domain and contribute further support for a theory of 'natural concepts' in this domain.","tags":null,"title":"\"Natural concepts\" revisited in the spatial-topological domain: Universal tendencies in focal spatial relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Various computational accounts of word learning have been proposed, with mechanisms ranging from storing and testing a single hypothesized referent for each word, to tracking multiple graded associations and selectively strengthening some of them. Nearly all word learning models assume storage of some feasible word-referent mappings from each situation, resulting in a degree of learning proportional to the number of co-occurrences. While these accumulative models would generally predict that incorrect co-occurrences would slow learning, recent empirical work suggests these accounts are incomplete: paradoxically, giving learners incorrect mappings early in training was found to boost performance (Fitneva \u0026 Christiansen, 2015). We test this finding's generality in a new experiment with more items, consider system- and item-level explanations, and find that a model with error-driven learning best accounts for this benefit of initially-inaccurate pairings.","tags":null,"title":"Evidence of error-driven cross-situational word learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Children are still in the process of learning category structure, and often fail to leverage the inductive power of these representations to their advantage. For example, young children generally fail to recognize the value of sampling diverse exemplars to support category-wide generalization. This study investigates whether teaching children the structure within a natural category increases diversity-based inductive reasoning. In an informal science learning environment, we presented 259 children aged 5 to 8 years with exemplars of the three main types of birds: raptors, songbirds, and waterbirds. After a short dialogue pointing out the various within-type similarities and between-type differences, children's diversity-based inductive reasoning did not significantly improve, despite them evidencing a better understanding of the category's structure. Instead, children tended to avoid sampling waterbirds, the least typical cluster of birds. These patterns suggest that children's neglect of sample diversity is unlikely to be solely due to their relative ignorance of category structure.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring informal science interventions to promote children's understanding of natural categories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.
