Despite the ambiguity of individual situations, a large body of empirical work shows that people are able to learn cross-situationally when a word occurs in different situations. Many computational models of cross-situational word learning have been proposed, yet there is little consensus on the main mechanisms supporting learning, in part due to the profusion of disparate studies and models, and lack of systematic model comparisons across a wide range of studies. This study compares the performance of several extant models on a dataset of 44 experimental conditions and a total of 1,696 participants. Using cross-validation, we fit multiple models representing theories of both associative learning and hypothesis-testing theories of word learning, find two best-fitting models, and discuss issues of model and mechanism identifiability. Finally, we test the models' ability to generalize to additional experiments, including developmental data.","tags":null,"title":"A large-scale comparison of cross-situational word learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Relatively little work has examined the categories and objects that tend to be in the infant view during everyday experience, despite the fact that this knowledge is central to theories of category learning. Here, we analyzed the prevalence of the  categories (e.g., people, animals, food) in the infant view in a longitudinal dataset of egocentric infant visual experience. Overall, we found a surprising amount of consistency in the broad characteristics of children's visual environment across individuals and across developmental time, in contrast to prior work examining the changing nature of the social signals in the infant view. In addition, we analyzed the distribution and identity of the categories that children tended touch and interact with in this dataset, generalizing previous findings that these objects tended to be distributed in a Zipfian manner. Taken together, these findings take a first step towards characterizing infants' changing visual environment, and call for future work to examine the generalizability of these results and to link them to learning outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Characterizing the object categories two children see and interact with in a dense dataset of naturalistic visual experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

The goal of this effort is to address theoretical and methodological challenges in measuring vocabulary development. We present two analyses of the current database (N=1,233): (1) capturing age-related changes in infants' word recognition while generalizing across item-level variability and (2) assessing how a central methodological decision -- selecting the time window of analysis -- impacts the reliability of measurement.

We then discuss their role in understanding several key mechanisms of language development: cross-situational statistical learning, embodiment, situated social interaction, intrinsically motivated learning, and cultural evolution.

Various computational accounts of word learning have been proposed, with mechanisms ranging from storing and testing a single hypothesized referent for each word, to tracking multiple graded associations and selectively strengthening some of them. Nearly all word learning models assume storage of some feasible word-referent mappings from each situation, resulting in a degree of learning proportional to the number of co-occurrences. While these accumulative models would generally predict that incorrect co-occurrences would slow learning, recent empirical work suggests these accounts are incomplete: paradoxically, giving learners incorrect mappings early in training was found to boost performance (Fitneva \u0026 Christiansen, 2015). We test this finding's generality in a new experiment with more items, consider system- and item-level explanations, and find that a model with error-driven learning best accounts for this benefit of initially-inaccurate pairings.","tags":null,"title":"Evidence of error-driven cross-situational word learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Children are still in the process of learning category structure, and often fail to leverage the inductive power of these representations to their advantage. For example, young children generally fail to recognize the value of sampling diverse exemplars to support category-wide generalization. This study investigates whether teaching children the structure within a natural category increases diversity-based inductive reasoning. In an informal science learning environment, we presented 259 children aged 5 to 8 years with exemplars of the three main types of birds: raptors, songbirds, and waterbirds. After a short dialogue pointing out the various within-type similarities and between-type differences, children's diversity-based inductive reasoning did not significantly improve, despite them evidencing a better understanding of the category's structure. Instead, children tended to avoid sampling waterbirds, the least typical cluster of birds. These patterns suggest that children's neglect of sample diversity is unlikely to be solely due to their relative ignorance of category structure.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring informal science interventions to promote children's understanding of natural categories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Many students experience difficulties in reading to successfully perform these tasks. Task-oriented reading is conceptualized as an adaptive problem-solving process in which readers engage with the text selectively based on the task. Usage of appropriate reading strategies leads to more efficient and accurate task performance. Our aim is to provide students with personalized support to effectively select reading strategies. A first step towards personalized support is the automatic detection of students’ reading strategies. This study describes the development of a supervised machine learning classifier to detect students’ reading strategies. Human raters classified 1,091 graphs of students’ behavior recorded on tablets as they engaged in task-oriented reading. These ratings were used to train a classifier on 13 features extracted from the students’ reading behavior. The overall accuracy for classifying reading strategies was 0.74, significantly greater than chance. Searched reading strategies were the easiest to identify, with a balanced accuracy of 0.84, followed by intensive (0.81) and targeted reading strategies (0.69). The most important features in the classifier were the ratio of sentences that readers skimmed too quickly, the number of unique sentences read, and the variance of time spent reading each sentence. These features are quite different from typical process variables used to study task-oriented reading, yet are easy to automatically extract in tablet- based reading. This classifier is a first step in the development of personalized support based on students' use of reading strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Detecting reading strategies during task-oriented reading: Building an automated classifier","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R. de Kleijn","G.

Memory consolidation–the process of crystallizing and integrating memories into knowledge and skills–is particularly benefitted by sleep. We survey the evidence that sleep aids memory consolidation in various declarative and implicit tasks and review the basic neurophysiological structure of sleep with a focus on understanding what neural systems are involved. Drawing on machine learning research, we discuss why it might be useful for humans–and robots, perhaps–to have such an offline period for processing, even though humans are clearly capable of learning incrementally, online. Finally, we propose and simulate two mechanisms for use in computational memory models to accomplish sleep-based consolidation via either or both 1) re-encoding knowledge representations and 2) reactivating and strengthening recent memories.","tags":null,"title":"A Dream Model: Reactivation and re-encoding mechanisms for sleep-dependent memory consolidation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

These word meanings form a network of associations that, influenced by environmental factors such as word frequency and contextual diversity, cause behavioral effects on measures such as lexical decision and naming times. We investigate the development of recognition priming as a function of explicit knowledge after repeated training and testing on a novel vocabulary. By varying the word frequency and contextual diversity of the training input, and examining learning trajectories as well as semantic knowledge effects, we shed light on which environmental factors most influence performance in language acquisition. Contextual diversity and entropy--the uncertainty about a word’s referents--are the two strongest factors predicting primed recognition times, and play a role along with frequency and context familiarity in predicting explicit learning.","tags":null,"title":"Developing semantic knowledge through cross-situational learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R. de Kleijn","G.
